# Videauth

## Introduction

First off, make sure you read http://www.dfrws.org/2014eu/proceedings/DFRWS-EU-2014-9.pdf (a copy of this file is in the docs folder).

Basically, the author say that the internal structures of a video file varies from one manufacturer to another and from one device to another.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a new layer of verification when checking the authenticity of a video file.

Usually, artefacts inside the video, live movement tracking, are used to determine if the file is vanilla or not. The author points out that little to no litterature / tools about doing so with files internal structure exist.

The goals of this project are:

 * Checking if we really can use this as a reliable way to check the authenticity of a video or not.
 * Provide an open-source, community driven, database of files to perform the checks on.
 * Provide open-source tools to check a file against the database.
